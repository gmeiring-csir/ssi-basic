## Setup Instructions

If the environment is set up correctly the following will build. We have to extend and test if the desired functionality is working but I could initiate an agent. 

1. `npm install`
2. Copy the contents of `/copy/indy-sdk-react-native_build.gradle` over the `node_modules/indy-sdk-react-native/build.gradle` as this implementation uses gradle 7+. 
3. `npm run android`
